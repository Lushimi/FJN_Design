# Bungi 

Bungi has a lot of rules and mechanics now. This is to help keep everything organized and have something we can refer back to.

 \
🛠 = Currently being changed / reworked


### 🃏 Stacking



* Can only stack up to 2.
    * Can stack up to 4 with BC tower upgrades.
* Stack ONLY in production zone
* Unstack & Field Stack effects (see Structures)


### ⛄ Units & Production



* You can only produce units in the production zone
* Unit type limit of 2, can be doubled by the BC/DC Unit type towers
* Units have separate health, power, costs, effects, movement, and targeting


### 💓 Hearts



* Hearts must be MOVED into to be destroyed (annihilating the moving piece)


### ❌🎮 Lose conditions



* Lose all hearts
* Lose all units


### 🎳🎲 Game Phases 



* Initial phase no longer exists, first board state and deck is determined before the game starts
* Active Phase: Can commit actions and commit counter phase actions
* Counter phase: Actions will come into play at the end of the other person's turn

🌞🏭  Sprites and Resources



* There are a finite number of resource tiles w/ a finite number of resources. 🛠 
* Sprites generate resources off of any resource tile at the start of your turn.
* Sprites bypass many unit mechanics.
    * Sprites can innately stack to 4.
    * Sprites can unstack and field stack.
    * Sprites have infinite unit-type limit.
* Sprites are limited in unique ways.
    * They are limited by a unique “sprite limit”.
    * They do not get omni-actions.
    * They do not spawn with a movement action.


### 🏢 Structures 



* Structures are mainly built with essence
* Construction time is 1 turn
* Structures provide massively important effects
* Structures can be upgraded to access new effects
* Structures have upgrade paths


### ✨ Essence 



* Essence drops from enemy deaths
* The amount of essence dropped depends on where on the board the enemy is killed
* The closer they are killed to your heart tiles, the more essence you get, with a maximum of 3
* You gain essence per stack shaved off a unit
* Essence Emporium is in the structures spreadsheet


### 👓 Special Must-Know Mechanics



*  ← Every other mechanic is explained through structures.
* Worker Efficiency - A resource tower upgrade that gives you more resources
* Sprite Pylons - A resource tower upgrade that can allow you to produce outside the production zones
* Unstacking
* Field Stacking
