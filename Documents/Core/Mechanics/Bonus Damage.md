A mechanic aimed to introduce a very small amount of randomness to break up stalemate situations.
Some units have a non-integer amount of power. The non-integer portion is converted into a probability of the chance to do 1 extra damage.
For example:
37.25 Power would mean
you hit from 37 damage
and
you have a 0.25% chance to hit for an extra 1pt of damage.
