## Sprite Structure
## Description
Provides upgrades and effects for resource gain and resource management. It is meant to create discrete steps the player can follow in order to progress in a match.

## Design intention
Each upgrade should feel like a substantial boost to your resource generation and provide you with more options in how you are managing your board state and interacting with resources.

Again not sure about this, the [structure spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18h0VKTvC8D_MD5jQfIg2HClgUCZUgnk6Giy1Re3xgm0/edit?gid=0#gid=0) works well enough
