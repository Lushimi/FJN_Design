## Create "zones" in the midgame

### Goal
Provide a more engaging midgame and increase positional strategy.

### Description
A structure (or otherwise) that uses resources (essence, BC, VC) to create areas on the board that your units must occupy to create different effects. These effects can vary from debuffs to your opponent or buffs to you.

### Proposed Impact
This would allow players to really see positional impact on the board in more ways than just getting from one side to the other. It would give more control over the pace of the game. May also allow designers to better test the impact of unbalanced units if they can take space too easily.

### References and Testing
Inspired by games like Civ and Spore(kinda)

### Limitations and Acknowledgements
The board size plays a significant factor in whether or not managing these "zones" would be realistic, it may have a need for more space. Powerful negative or positive effects from a zone may precipitate more snowball victories if not balanced properly. Not sure if the movement of current units as a whole allows for space keeping in a dynamic way that allows players to strategize around taking or giving up zones satisfyingly.

### Open Questions
What buffs or debuffs could they give? When in the game could you place them? How large will the zones be? How expensive will the zones be? How important will it be to have a zone occupied?
