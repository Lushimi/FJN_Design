# Main Unit vs. Clones

### Goal
* Make it easier to theme narratively.
* Provide new ways to engage with resource management and management of units.
* Provide designers more granular control of when and how much new units can be produced.
* More clarity in discerning opponent's board state via looking at how many clones they have left.
* Introduces a super risky strategy involving using your main unit when out of clones.
* Provides more clarity to see who has more advantage by looking at who has more clones available.

### Description
Summoning a unit now requires the player to make a distinction between the main unit or a clone unit. The main unit can be placed with no resource cost, but will permanently be removed from the game when killed. Clones function pretty much identically to how they are implemented currently. The ability to summon a clone depends on a clone meter that recharges over turns.

### Proposed Impact
Does not impact the balance of the game too much. Just provides more clarity and narrative spice to the value of units. The amount of clones available to the player and their clone recharge bar can also be controlled through structures like already being done.

### References and Testing
Shogi has a similar way of providing immediate board state feedback at a glance by looking at how many captured pieces one player has.

### Limitations and Acknowledgements
Clone meter might not be a full solution to balance how many clones are summoned.

### Open Questions
What is a good amount of clones to give the player in early, mid, and late game phases?
Should each unit have the same amount of clones available to them?
