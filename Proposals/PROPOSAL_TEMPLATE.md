# EXAMPLE
## Make resource tiles infinite

### Goal
Provide more plays for the matches that extend very late.

### Description
All resource tiles would no longer have a limited supply of resource they can give out.

### Proposed Impact
This would eliminate players planning around a finite supply of resources and allow more creativity in plays by increasing the maximum amount of plays they could make during a match.
It's also to the benefit of players who like to play defensively as they can gain an infinite amount of resources by defending before they move out their units.

### References and Testing
Clash Royale does this.

### Limitations and Acknowledgements
It would fundamentally skew advantage heavily towards the defensive player as the game currently does not have a timer. And it could potentially create infinite stalemates.

### Open Questions
Would players find late game match extensions fun?
